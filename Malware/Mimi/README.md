Challenge:

![Challenge](images/1.challenge.PNG)

We are given a memory dump and tasked with recoverying the user's password.

![Extracting File](images/2.extracting.PNG)

After extracting and examining the file, we can confirm it is a memory dump.  Based on this, we should analyze the memory dump to see what we can find.

The tool of choice for this is [pypykatz](https://github.com/skelsec/pypykatz/)

After installing the latest version, we can run the following to extract the contents.

```pypykatz lsa minidump ~/Downloads/huntress/mimi/mimi```

Among the passwords, we see our flag.
